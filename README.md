# amphib_competition_drying

# experimental data from the manuscript "Asymmetric competition shapes amphibian response to rapid environmental change". 
# Authors: Lindsey L. Thurman and Tiffany S. Garcia

# Treatments:
Intraspecific competition treatments: A = Pacific chorus frog; B = Cascades frog; C = Western toad; 

Pairwise, interspecific competition treatments: D = Pacific chorus frog and Cascades frog; E = Cascades frog and Western toad; F = Pacifc chorus frog and Western toad

Three-species competition treatment:
G = Pacific chorus frog, Cascades frog, and Western toad

Hydroperiod treatments: Permanent, Drying

# File information: 

# Larvaldata.csv
Experimental results for performance measures taken during the larval period of growth and development.

Column headers:

Data = Date
SamplingPeriod = 10-day intervals (7 sampling periods total, including sampling on day 0 = sampling period 1)
Block = The experiment was blocked so that individuals in each of the five treatment combination replicates were sampled sequentially   over the course of five days (e.g. first day of sampling = 1 replicate of all 7 x 2 treatment combinations)
Tub = experimental mesocosm tub 
TreatComp = Competition treatment (See information above for letter coding)
TreatHydro = Hydroperiod treatment
Species = four-letter Genus and species code (e.g. PSRE = Pseudacris regilla/Pacific chorus frog)
TotalNumIndiv = total number of individuals alive (including larvae and metamorphs) 
NumLarvae = total number of larvae alive 
PropLarvae = proportion of larvae alive (out of total, including metamorphs) 
LarvBiomass = larval biomass (g) measured as the collective weight of all larvae in a tub
IndivLarvWt = average weight of larvae measured as LarvBiomass divided by NumLarvae
Gosner = average Gosner developmental stage 


# Emergencedata.csv
Experimental results for time to emergence.

Column headers (not previously described):

NumMetas = total number of individuals that metamorphosed by the end of the experiment
AvgDays = average number of days to emergence
NPossible = total number of individuals at the beginning of the experiment



# Metamorphdata.csv
