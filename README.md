# amphib_competition_drying

# experimental data from the manuscript "Asymmetric competition shapes amphibian response to rapid environmental change". 
# Authors: Lindsey L. Thurman and Tiffany S. Garcia

# Treatments:
Intraspecific competition treatments: A = Pacific chorus frog; B = Cascades frog; C = Western toad; 

Pairwise, interspecific competition treatments: D = Pacific chorus frog and Cascades frog; E = Cascades frog and Western toad; F = Pacifc chorus frog and Western toad

Three-species competition treatment:
G = Pacific chorus frog, Cascades frog, and Western toad

Hydroperiod treatments: Permanent, Drying

Column headers:

Data = Date

SamplingPeriod = 10-day intervals (7 sampling periods total, including sampling on day 0 = sampling period 1)

Block = The experiment was blocked so that individuals in each of the five treatment combination replicates were sampled sequentially over the course of five days (e.g. first day of sampling = 1 replicate of all 7 x 2 treatment combinations)

Tub = experimental mesocosm tub 

TreatComp = Competition treatment (See information above for letter coding)

TreatHydro = Hydroperiod treatment

TempMean = mean temperature for each sampling period (sensors in Block 1)

TempRange = range of aquatic temperature for each sampling period (sensors in Block 1)

TempSD = standard deviation of aquatic temperature for each sampling period (sensors in Block 1)

Species = four-letter Genus and species code (e.g. PSRE = Pseudacris regilla/Pacific chorus frog)

TotalNum = total number of individuals alive (including larvae and metamorphs) 

NumLarvae = total number of larvae alive 

PropLarvae = proportion of larvae alive (out of total, including metamorphs) 

NumMetas = total number of metamorphs alive

PropMetas = proportion of metamorphs alive (out of total, including larvae)

LarvBiomass = larval biomass (g) measured as the collective weight of all larvae in a tub

IndivLarvWt = average weight of larvae measured as LarvBiomass divided by NumLarvae

Gosner = average Gosner developmental stage
